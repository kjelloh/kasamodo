# Kasamodo name rational

The name is a word play on 'Kasa' from Spanish for 'house' or 'home' and 'Modo' eluding to 'modular', 'modify', 'mode' like state of mind or a way of tackling a task etc.

The name may lend itself to 'kasamodify' as taking the design of an existing house and make it fullfill the goals of being a 'kasamodo'.

And maybe 'KasaModo' sounding like 'Quasimodo' is a positivbe thing? Quasimodo is the main character in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (original French title: Notre-Dame de Paris) by Victor Hugo.

The chatGPT provided the following 'reasoning' on 'KasaModo' vs 'Quasimodo' being a 'good' thing.

<div style="font-style: italic;">
    <p>The resemblance between "Kasamodo" and "Quasimodo" can actually be a good and powerful thing, depending on how you frame it. Here's why:</p>
    <h3>Resonant Themes You Can Embrace</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Misjudged from the Outside, Beautiful Within</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Quasimodo was seen as monstrous because of his appearance, but he had a noble heart.</li>
        <li>Kasamodo, as a modular house, might not look like a conventional house — but it's smart, efficient, and deeply human-centered.</li>
        <li>This parallel can position Kasamodo as an underdog hero of housing — humble, rugged, but full of heart.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Isolation to Belonging</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Quasimodo longed for acceptance and a place to belong.</em></li>
        <li>Kasamodo offers that exact thing: a home that can be moved, adapted, and owned by people often pushed to the margins (e.g., nomads, minimalists, eco-conscious DIYers).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cathedral vs. Module</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Quasimodo lived in the Notre-Dame Cathedral, a massive, ancient symbol.</li>
        <li>Kasamodo could be framed as the modern-day, human-scale sanctuary — a modular “cathedral of the self.”</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Possible Risks (and How to Flip Them)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The name similarity might lead some to think of Quasimodo's deformity or tragedy, but you can reclaim that:</li>
    <li>Use language like: <em>“Kasamodo — beautiful where it counts.”</em></li>
    <li>Or: <em>“Not conventional. Just essential.”</em></li>
    </ul>
